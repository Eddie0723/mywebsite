  <p style=color:white> My name is Eddie Lopez.
  
  <p style=color:white> My unhealthy obsessions is video games, which I play everyday and nearly constantly since I don't have much to do. I play quite a few different games since if I play only one game I get extremely bored.
    
     <p style=color:white> A few of the video games I play all the time are: Minecraft, Fallout 4, Borderlands 2 and 3, and Terarria. I also play quite a few other games but I play these the most.
